Description: When assigned "Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models
  in R" (Walker (2023, ISBN: 1032366443)), students should read the book and
  type in all the associated R commands themselves. Sadly, that never happens.
  These tutorials allow students to demonstrate (and their instructors
  to be sure) that all work has been completed. See Kane (2023)
